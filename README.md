Sometimes server does not let copy some data to local machine so to not deleting all and rpeating same >30 min step, script reads prepared txt files with server side ids and local side ids. If there are some differences it will tell. When data is <100, I can compare on excel file by coloring filters, but its not possible to do that when there is >1000 data.
